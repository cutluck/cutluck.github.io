    - Understand the problem
        - What kind of problem is it?
            | Evaluate
            | Find
            | Exist
    - Understand the data
    - Understand the objective
    - Select good notation
    - Write down what you know in the notation selected; draw a diagram
    - Modify the problem slightly
        | Special case
        | Simplified version of problem
        | Which would imply the problem
        | Derive some consequence of the problem
        | Reformulate the problem
        | Examine similar problem
        | Generalize the problem
    - Modify the problem significantly
```
Modify the problem significantly. In this more aggressive type of
strategy, we perform major modifications to a problem such as removing data, swapping the data with the objective, or negating the objective
(e.g. trying to disprove a statement rather than prove it). Basically, we try
to push the problem until it breaks, and then try to identify where the breakdown occurred; this identifies what the key components of the data are, as
well as where the main difficulty will lie. These exercises can also help in
getting an instinctive feel of what strategies are likely to work, and which
ones are likely to fail.

    - Prove results about our question
    - Simplify, exploit data, and reach tactical goals
